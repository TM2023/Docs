The TM2023 Project
Legit copy of TM2023 Project report;
Official version;
“Let’s try hard, and resolve them toghether, the result would not be bad...”
We really think... Trying hard will only make the result be good. And we also trying. In this project, we will try very very hard on it. A plugin update! Develop your own plugin and share that to community. Chance of your plugin will be used by us based on how good your plugin quality are. If you collect enough Credits you will got the Active Developers role.
We planned our Plugins should be:
-	Not accepting bad plugins
-	Allow plugins to self-destroy if encounter an error
-	Allow plugins to use available plugins as library (Required “/libs” folder)
-	Have advanced settings/functions so people can customize their plugins to the best
